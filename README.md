## Install

Once `v0.0.10` is tagged:

```sh
npm install @passmcp/sdk@0.0.10
```

---

## Requirements

| Requirement | Floor | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Toolchain | Node.js 22+ / TypeScript 5+ | Enforced in `package.json` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Licence | Apache-2.0 | Safe to embed in proprietary and open-source gateways, agents, and servers |
| Network | None for verification | Attestation parsing and `covers()` run strictly offline |

---

## Quick Start

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { McpServer, parseStatement } from "@passmcp/sdk";

const srv = new McpServer({ name: "billing", version: "0.0.10" });
srv.registerTool(
  { name: "health", description: "Read-only health probe", readOnlyHint: true },
  async () => ({ content: [{ type: "text", text: "ok" }] }),
);

const st = parseStatement(readFileSync("testdata/statement.json", "utf8"));
if (!st.covers("http", "https://mcp.example.com/mcp")) {
  throw new Error("untrusted server");
}
```

## The passmcp-sdk-typescript ecosystem

Every component is released at **0.0.9** and moves in lockstep: one version across the family, released together ([docs/ecosystem.md](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp/blob/main/docs/ecosystem.md)).

| Component | Purpose | Use case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [passmcp](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp) | The MCP server diagnostic: checks in nine phases, every finding tied to the request that showed it, signed attestations | Test a server before your agents trust it, and gate it in CI |
| [passmcp-reporting](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp-reporting) | The attestation format, its JSON Schemas and offline verifier, the graph model, and the agentgateway processor | Verify an attestation in a gateway, registry or pipeline |
| [passmcp-server](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp-server) | passmcp's diagnostics as read-only MCP tools | Evaluate a server, or check an attestation, from inside the agent |
| [passmcp-action](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp-action) | passmcp in GitHub Actions and GitLab CI, the image pinned by digest | Fail a build on the findings you choose |

| [passmcp-sdk-python](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp-sdk-python) | Apache-2.0 Python MCP client and server SDK with offline attestation verification (not yet released) | Build an MCP server or client in Python that clears passmcp's checks and verifies attestations offline |
| [passmcp-sdk-java](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp-sdk-java) | Apache-2.0 Java MCP client and server SDK with offline attestation verification (not yet released) | Build an MCP server or client in Java that clears passmcp's checks and verifies attestations offline |
| [passmcp-sdk-cpp](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp-sdk-cpp) | Apache-2.0 C++20 MCP client and server SDK with offline attestation verification (not yet released) | Build an MCP server or client in C++ that clears passmcp's checks and verifies attestations offline |
| [passmcp-sdk-typescript](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp-sdk-typescript) | Apache-2.0 TypeScript MCP client and server SDK with offline attestation verification (not yet released) | Build an MCP server or client in TypeScript that clears passmcp's checks and verifies attestations offline |
| [passmcp-sdk-rust](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp-sdk-rust) | Apache-2.0 Rust MCP client and server SDK with offline attestation verification (not yet released) | Build an MCP server or client in Rust that clears passmcp's checks and verifies attestations offline |

## Capabilities at a glance

| Area | Capability | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Transports | Line-delimited `stdio` (`serveStdio`, `StdioTransport`) and Streamable HTTP (`StreamableHttpHandler`, Web `fetch` & `node:http`, `HttpClientTransport`) | On `feat/v0.0.10` |
| Protocol | JSON-RPC 2.0 `initialize`, `ping`, stateless `server/discover`, and `2026-07-28` mirrored header validation (`-32020`) | On `feat/v0.0.10` |
| Capability & schema gating | Derived `capabilities`, JSON Schema `inputSchema` validation (`-32602`), `structuredContent`, and `-32601` for undeclared RPCs | On `feat/v0.0.10` |
| SEP-2164 & SEP-2549 | Missing `resources/read` returns `-32602` + `error.data.uri` (`2026-07-28`); list responses validate & emit `ttlMs` / `cacheScope` | On `feat/v0.0.10` |
| Auth, Origin & safety | OAuth 2.1 S256 PKCE, RFC 9728 / RFC 8414 metadata validation, `OriginGuard`, and `readOnlyHint: true` default client policy | On `feat/v0.0.10` |
| Attestation | Offline `in-toto` `Statement/v1` (`mcp-evaluation/v1`) SHA-256 / SHA-512 target-descriptor verifier | On `feat/v0.0.10` |

---

## Ecosystem comparison

| Property | `passmcp-sdk-typescript` | Generic JSON-RPC / default SDK scaffolding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Undeclared capability RPCs | Derived from registered handlers; `-32601` automatically | Often left wired with empty lists or generic `-32603` errors |
| SEP-2164 & SEP-2549 (`2026-07-28`) | Built into resource reads and list responses | Hand-rolled per server |
| Client tool safety | Refuses unannotated tools by default (ADR 0004) | Executes any tool unless caller filters |
| Offline `passmcp` attestation check | Built-in `parse` / `validate` / `covers` / `verdict_for` | Custom SHA-256 + schema glue |

---

## Benchmarks

Micro-benchmarks for JSON-RPC dispatch and SHA-256 / SHA-512 statement
verification are run via `make test` and will be published with hardware notes
at the first tagged release (`v0.0.10`).

---

## Features

- **Server & client symmetry**: build servers that clear `passmcp check` and
  clients that enforce `passmcp` attestations and `readOnlyHint` policies before
  calling tools.
- **Stateless discovery (`server/discover`)**: one-request discovery of protocol
  revision, server identity, capabilities, tools, resources, templates, and
  prompts.
- **Zero-network attestation verification**: verifies `in-toto` statements
  against `passmcp-reporting`'s canonical target descriptor format.

---

## Configuration

Server and client options are passed explicitly via typed constructors (protocol
revision, allowed HTTP `Origin` values, SEP-2549 cache hints, and client
mutation policy) with zero hidden environment-variable magic.

---

## Examples

Run `make example` to execute [`examples/quickstart.ts`](examples/quickstart.ts),
or spawn [`examples/stdio-server.mjs`](examples/stdio-server.mjs) under `passmcp check --stdio`
(`100/100`, grade `A`, `0` failures, `0` warnings).

---

## When not to use passmcp-sdk-typescript

- **Diagnosing an existing third-party MCP server from the CLI or CI**: use
  [`passmcp`](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/passmcp) directly.
- **Verifying DSSE / Sigstore cryptographic signatures**: verify the outer
  envelope with `cosign` or `gh attestation verify` first, then pass the
  verified statement payload to `passmcp-sdk-typescript`.

---

## Development

```sh
make check
```

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private vulnerability reporting and security
invariants.

---

## Stability guarantees

Pre-1.0 versions move in lockstep with `passmcp` by `0.0.1` increments. Any
change to what attestation verification accepts is treated as a breaking change
requiring a tracking issue and ADR update.
